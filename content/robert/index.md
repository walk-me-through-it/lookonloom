## What's good about this site so far

- Looks professional
- apart from the lack of images and detail, I would say it does not look cheap. You might not agree!
- Responsive: works well on different screen sizes, mobile etc

## To Do

- Make the big Loom logo on the front clickable with popup hints. We can make this graphic the centre of the navigation if you like
- build another site along the same lines for corporate
- build another site using the same layout for investors
- smaller images (Katrina etc)
- do a better find a law firm mockup

I won't do these until we're happy with the look and feel here

- add many more sections
- add more colour? The grey is following the logo, the indigo is from the booklet, but we could be much more cheerful

## To improve

- The body text font is probably too small for you guys, right?
- The site looks sober and corporate. It could look a lot friendlier. Part of that is using more pictures, part of that is the design.
- The organisation. It seems odd to me having the outsourcing here at all. I would tend to favour one site for B2B and another, friendlier site for B2C. I discussed that with Nigel quite a bit and I think he doesn't favour that but would wait and see?
