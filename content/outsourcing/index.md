## Can’t get the staff? 

Too much work and not enough well-trained staff is putting conveyancers in danger. 

There is a recruitment problem across conveyancing and it’s even more difficult for forward-thinking firms to recruit as fast as they want to grow. 
Mistakes do happen: residential conveyancing remains the biggest source of PI claims. 

## Feeling the strain? 
Residential conveyancing is a challenging market with pressure from all sides: 

* The ongoing race to the 
bottom on fees 
* More demanding clients 
* More regulation: AML, GDPR and outcomes-based SRA rules 
* Lenders, PI insurers and panels demanding consistency and transparency in processing of cases 

## Unlock the value of your organisation 

Your firm is already well-placed to withstand these pressures because you have a strong brand, a good reputation and good processes in place already. Outsourcing helps unlock more of that value.

There is a huge opportunity here, particularly for early movers. By combining Loom outsourcing with the latest conveyancing technology, UK law firms can draw upon a highly professional and scalable resource while increasing margins and improving customer experience.

Panel work is notoriously competitive, but Loom makes growth through panel work a real possibility.
