			<h1>Next-level conveyancing growth with Loom Legal outsourcing  </h1>

			

<h2 id="a-new-opportunity-for-forward-thinking-law-firms">A new opportunity for forward-thinking law firms</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is your conveyancing team ready to grow?</li>
<li>You are a forward-thinking law firm You are strong on customer service</li>
<li>You are process-driven, risk-managed and fully compliant with regulation</li>
<li>You have built a brand and reputation ready to take to the next level</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="your-firm-is-a-good-fit-for-loom-legal">Your firm is a good fit for Loom Legal.</h3>

<p>We are working with well-managed law firms who are delivering quality conveyancing services with best practice, strong customer-focus and a good reputation. We enable the best firms to use the
advantages you have already built to grow through outsourcing.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-a-good-conveyancing-system-in-place">Do you have a good conveyancing system in place?</h3>

<p>We can make Loom
Conveyancing work with any good conveyancing software.</p>

<h3 id="or-are-you-not-using-a-conveyancing-system">Or are you not using a conveyancing system?</h3>

<p>We recommend Intelliworks Conveyancing from <a href="http://www.ochresoft.com">Ochresoft</a>.</p>

<p>Loom Legal’s team is drawn from ex-Ochresoft employees. We are very familiar with Intelliworks Conveyancing. In
our opinion, it is the best product for UK residential conveyancers. But you are free to use any comparable system.</p>

<h2 id="loom-legal-outsourcing-for-conveyancers">Loom Legal Outsourcing for conveyancers</h2>

<h3 id="a-big-opportunity-for-the-best-conveyancing-teams">A big opportunity for the best conveyancing teams</h3>

<p>You’ve already built a strong practice, now Loom Legal outsourcing for conveyancers lets you take your business to the next level without expanding your teams.
Increased capacity without a big increase in cost</p>

<ul>
<li>Better, stress-free scalable staffing to manage any workload</li>
<li>‘Blue chip’ data protection and data security from a major multinational service partner WNS Global</li>
<li>Improved risk management</li>
<li>Better client care and quality of service</li>
<li>Lower costs (less than £100 per transaction from start to finish)</li>
</ul>

<p>… all managed by Loom Legal, specialists in UK conveyancing outsourcing for growth</p>

<h2 id="can-t-get-the-staff">Can’t get the staff?</h2>

<p>Too much work and not enough well-trained staff is putting conveyancers in danger.</p>

<p>There is a recruitment problem across conveyancing and it’s even more difficult for forward-thinking firms to recruit as fast as they want to grow.
Mistakes do happen: residential conveyancing remains the biggest source of PI claims.</p>

<h2 id="feeling-the-strain">Feeling the strain?</h2>

<p>Residential conveyancing is a challenging market with pressure from all sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ongoing race to the
bottom on fees</li>
<li>More demanding clients</li>
<li>More regulation: AML, GDPR and outcomes-based SRA rules</li>
<li>Lenders, PI insurers and panels demanding consistency and transparency in processing of cases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unlock-the-value-of-your-organisation">Unlock the value of your organisation</h2>

<p>Your firm is already well-placed to withstand these pressures because you have a strong brand, a good reputation and good processes in place already. Outsourcing helps unlock more of that value.
A huge opportunity for UK law firms: Loom outsourcing + technology</p>

<p>There is a huge opportunity here, particularly for early movers. By combining Loom outsourcing with the latest conveyancing technology, UK law firms can draw upon a highly professional and scalable resource while increasing margins and improving customer experience.
The robust and process-driven workflow that Loom Legal offers means you can be absolutely assured of best practice for every client.</p>

<h2 id="free-up-your-teams">Free up your teams</h2>

<p>Loom Legal specialist outsourcing for conveyancers unlocks the value in the systems you already have by relieving staffing and training pressure. It frees your teams to do what they do best and makes your business flexible enough to focus on growth and opportunity.
We provide the specialist resource you need, at low cost and only when you need it.</p>

<p>Everything is process-driven, quality controlled and fully monitored.</p>

<h2 id="panel-work-really-can-be-profitable-for-every-firm">Panel work really can be profitable for every firm</h2>

<p>Outsourcing doesn’t just increase margins, it can open up whole sources of work.
Panel work is notoriously competitive, but Loom makes growth through panel work a real possibility.</p>

<h2 id="use-your-firm-s-good-reputation-to-drive-growth">Use your firm’s good reputation to drive growth</h2>

<p>Because all of this happens behind the scenes, you can grow the business while making the best advantage of your firm’s reputation.
And because everything is process and risk managed, you can actually improve customer satisfaction at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-loom-legal">Who are Loom Legal?</h2>

<h2 id="how-does-the-outsourcing-work-what-about-my-client">How does the outsourcing work? What about my client?</h2>

<h2 id="why-outsource-with-loom-legal">Why outsource with Loom Legal?</h2>

<h3 id="control-of-workload">Control of workload</h3>

<h3 id="quality-control">Quality control</h3>

<p>You set the business process rules and the quality requirements for your clients. If you specify that something is checked, it will be checked and logged for every case.
And you might be surprised how knowledgeable WNS’s specialist legal teams are.</p>

<h3 id="better-client-care">Better client care</h3>

<p>We don’t use call centres or take calls for you; it will always be your staff communicating with your clients. The documents and letters WNS send will be your documents and letters. Your clients have no idea there is a third party involved, but your staff will see the benefit, freeing them up to provide better and more efficient client care.</p>

<h3 id="cost-savings">Cost savings</h3>

<p>And yes, at less than £100 per transaction from start to finish, outsourcing can save you money, and improve standards at the same time.</p>
