      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s good about this site so far  Looks professional apart from the lack of images and detail, I would say it does not look cheap. You might not agree! Responsive: works well on different screen sizes, mobile etc  To Do  Make the big Loom logo on the front clickable with popup hints. We can make this graphic the centre of the navigation if you like build another site along the same lines for corporate build another site using the same layout for investors smaller images (Katrina etc) do a better find a law firm mockup  I won&amp;rsquo;t do these until we&amp;rsquo;re happy with the look and feel here</description>
